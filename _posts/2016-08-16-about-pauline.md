# About Pauline

Pauline has a long history in providing the highest levels of service for the most discerning of international clients. Starting her career in the demanding world of private banking, Pauline enjoyed developing close working relationships with high net worth clients around the world taking time to understand their varied needs and providing highly bespoke solutions.

Following a move to Dubai in 2002, Pauline was clear to find new opportunities where her love of assisting clients could be combined with her passion for property. Pauline established the first luxury property focussed estate agency in Dubai in 2003, which grew to be one of the most successful agents in the UAE. More recently, Pauline has established a new boutique agency, returning to her core interest in helping high net worth clients in securing the very best property in the UAE and around the world.
